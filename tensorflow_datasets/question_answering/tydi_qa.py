_DESCRIPTION = """\
TyDi QA is a question answering dataset covering 11 typologically diverse \
languages with 204K question-answer pairs. The languages of TyDi QA are \
diverse with regard to their typology -- the set of linguistic features that \
each language expresses -- such that we expect models performing well on this \
set to generalize across a large number of the languages in the world. It \
contains language phenomena that would not be found in English-only corpora. \
To provide a realistic information-seeking task and avoid priming effects, \
questions are written by people who want to know the answer, but donâ€™t know \
the answer yet, (unlike SQuAD and its descendents) and the data is collected \
directly in each language without the use of translation (unlike MLQA and \
XQuAD).

For now, only the Gold passage (GoldP) task is available in TFDS.
